# XMPP JavaScript project [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/csutorasa/xmpp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/csutorasa/xmpp)

## Developer guide

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies. Build the application and run it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/csutorasa/xmpp.git
cd xmpp
npm install
npm start
```

If you want to modify the source code incremental builds can be used. This will produce clean output and restarts the server each time a build has finished successfully.

Use the following command:

```bash
npm run watch
```

## Continous integration

Travis CI is used to check the state of the builds. You can check it [here](https://travis-ci.org/csutorasa/xmpp).
